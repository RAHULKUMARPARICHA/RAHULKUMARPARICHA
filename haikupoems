Ah, haikus! They're like tiny poetry snacks – think of them as poetic tapas. You've got three lines to work with, but here's the catch: the first line has 5 syllables, the second line has 7, and the third goes back to 5. It's like a syllable sandwich! So you gotta be concise, like trying to tell a big story with just a handful of words. It's like poetry on a diet – short, sweet, and to the point! And let's be real, who doesn't love a good syllable challenge? It's like a crossword puzzle for wordsmiths!

This code? It's like a poetry vending machine! You know those haikus with their 5-7-5 syllables? Well, this program randomly picks lines from a bunch of haikus stored inside it. It's like rolling a dice for each line and seeing what you get! And hey, it even sets the dice to roll differently every time you run it, so you'll always get a fresh, surprise haiku. It's like having a poet with a slot machine!
